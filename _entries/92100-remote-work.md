Although we are not a remote work company,
we understand that occasionally
some of us end up working remotely
for short periods of time.
To make this easier,
we try to structure our communication
to accommodate remote work.

Let people know when you're available:

- When you start your day,
  let the rest of the team know
  by posting a message on the `#general` Slack channel,
- When you're going to be away
  for more than a few minutes,
  let people know by posting a message to the `#general` channel,
  eg. "afk for lunch - be back in an hour"
- Let people know when you're logging out for the day.

Share daily targets and status:

- We have a `daily_target` channel,
  where we post a list of things
  that we're going to tackle today.
  Everyone posts their targets here
  when they start the day.
- We have a `my_status` channel,
  where everybody summarizes
  things they have completed that day.
- These are not just for remote developers,
  but for everyone.

A big challenge in working remotely
is communicating effectively.
It isn't easy to understand somebody's tone
when you only talk to them over chat.
Words that sound neutral when you say them in person
sometimes sound harsh when you see them on the screen.

For this reason,
we try to make sure everybody is mindful
about their how their messages come across,
whether it is in Slack
or in code reviews.
When in doubt,
make use of happy emojis. ;)
