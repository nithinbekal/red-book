**communication** is key for any organization. We feel that its our responsibility to have our clients and team members involved in our discussions and decisions. Thus to ensure everyones participations we make use of multiple tools. But regardless of the tool we use,  always keep the points below in mind.

### Tools


 **Text**
 [Slack](slack.com) is our tool for text communication. Red Panthers, internal communication would be happening at https://redpanthers.slack.com.

For each of our clients, we make a slack account in their name (if they don't have one), for example: **clientname.slack.com**. We would also set all the external services to send notification to the clients slack.

**Video & Audio**
Skype is our tool of choice for video & audio chats. It is mandatory for us to have a group team meeting with client at least once a week. Daily one on one meeting can be scheduled as and when necessary. Always try to have a synchronous form of communication when you find yourself with a lot of questions while reading the project requirements or while reviewing the code.
