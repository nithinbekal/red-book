**Communication** is key for any organization.
We feel that its our responsibility
to have our clients and team members
involved in our discussions and decisions.
To ensure everyones participation,
we make use of multiple tools.
But regardless of the tool we use,
always keep the points below in mind:

- Over communication is not a problem
- Never make assumptions - always confirm

### Tools

 **Text**
 [Slack](slack.com) is our tool for text communication.
 Red Panthers' internal communication happens at
 <https://redpanthers.slack.com>.

For each of our clients,
we make a slack account in their name
(if they don't have one).
For example: **clientname.slack.com**.
We also set all the external services
to send notification to the clients slack.

**Video & Audio**
Skype is our tool of choice for video & audio chats.
It is mandatory for us to have a group team meeting
with client at least once a week.
Daily one on one meeting can be scheduled as and when necessary.
Always try to have a synchronous form of communication
when you find yourself with a lot of questions
while reading the project requirements
or while reviewing the code.
