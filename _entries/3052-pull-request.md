Pull Request is generally created when you want something merged with another branch. But at Red Panthers, since we would 
love to doing code review and not leave everything until the end, we prefer to have a PR made as soon as they start working on 
the project.

To let people know that the work is not complete. Just have the issue marked with the label "work in progress". Once in a while you 
can ask the architect of the project or someone else in your team to do code reviews.

When you feel your work is complete, then mark the PR & Issue with the label "ready for review".

After the review, the reviewer should mark it as "ready for merge". And now you are ready to merge the issue to master.
