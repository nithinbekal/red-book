Pull Request is generally created when you want something merged with another branch.
At Red Panthers,
we prefer getting feedback right away,
rather than leaving things till the end.
Create a PR as soon as you create the first commit,
so others can jump in
and give you feedback even before you've finished with the PR.

To let people know that the work is not complete,
mark the issue with the label "work in progress".

When you feel your work is complete,
mark the PR and the issue
with the label "ready for review".
At this point,
share the link to the pull request on the project's Slack channel,
and `@` mention a couple of people requesting a review.
Ideally, these would be people
who are familiar with the part of the codebase you're changing,
but you can also request reviews
from people who aren't part of the project
to get fresh perspective on the code.

After the review,
the reviewer should mark it as "ready for merge".
And now you are ready to merge the issue to master.
