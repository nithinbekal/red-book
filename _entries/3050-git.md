Git is our tool of choice
when it comes to source code management
and code collaboration.

We use
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
for our internal projects and
[Github](https://github.com/redpanthers)
when we are collaborating with developers from the client side.
We also use Github to manage our open source projects as well.

Since Gitlab and Github are similar in working,
we will be refering them both as just Github in this section.

If you're unfamiliar with git,
then please take a look at
[Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/)
and
[Github Git Tutorial](http://try.github.com/).

- We place all our open source projects under our
  [github team account](https://github.com/redpanthers).
- Our projects (client/internal) are placed under
  our Gitlab account
