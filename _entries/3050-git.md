Git is our tool of choice when it comes to source code management and code collaboration.

We use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) for our internal projects and [Github](https://github.com/redpanthers) when we collaborating with developers from the client side. We also you github to manage our open source project as well.

Since gitlab and github are similar in working, we will be refering them both as just github in this section.
