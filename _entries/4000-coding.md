> Code reviews are not about you,

> Never take a code review personally.

**General**

* A person has to make a pull request for the code to be reviewed
* Code has to be reviewed before merging it
* In case of hotfixes when no one is available for review,
  you may merge it,
  but it should be your responsibility
  to have someone else review the code
  as soon as possible
* Ask questions,
  do not make demands.
  (Eg: What do you think
  about naming the method "priority_callback"?
  Would that be better?)
* Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits.
  ("dumb", "stupid").
  Assume everyone is intelligent, and well-meaning.
* Be explicit,
  do not make assumptions
  or jump to conclusions.
* Be humble
  ("I'm not sure - let's look it up.")
* Absolutely no sarcasm!
* There may be cases where
  reviewing asynchronously may not be easy.
  In such cases,
  feel free to discuss in person
  or over chat or Skype.

**Reviewer**
 
* Offer alternative implementations,
  but assume the author already considered them.
  ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?")
* Try to understand the author's perspective
* Merge once you feel confident in the code and its impact on the project
* Check if the code is simple and clear
