<center><b> Review is for the code not for you, so don't take it personally.</b></center>
<br>

**General**

* A person has to make a pull request for the code to be reviewed
* Code has to be reviewed before merging it
* Incase of Hot Fix and no one is available for review, you may merge it, but it should be your responsibility to have someone
else review the code as soon as someone becomes available
* Ask questions, do not make demands. (Eg: What do you think about naming the method "priority_callback"? Won't it be better?)
* Avoid using terms that could be seen as referring to personal traits. ("dumb", "stupid"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.
* Be explicit, do not make assumption or conclusion.
* Be humble ("I'm not sure - let's look it up.")
* Absolutely no sarcasm!! 
* Talk synchronously - over chat, skype or in person.


**Reviewer**
 
* Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?")
* Try to understand the author's perspective
* Merge once you feel confident in the code and its impact on the project
* Check if the code is simple and clear
