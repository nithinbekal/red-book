We come across new problems
and interesting bugs all the time.
Writing about them helps you learn even more about the topic
and lets you share the learnings
with your teammates and the community.

When you get a new idea for a blog,
discuss it in the #blog Slack channel,
and add a card to the blogging Trello board.

When writing a blog post,
keep the following in mind:

- Write from the perspective of the team -
  **use "we" rather that "I"**.
- **Run your code examples**
  to make sure they work.
- When providing references,
  **prefer links to official documentation**
  or other reliable links
  rather than random blog posts.
