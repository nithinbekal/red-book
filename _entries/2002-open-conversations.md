To make sure that all the members of the team are aware
about what everyone else is working on,
it is important to keep an open channel of communication
We insist that no communication should happen via direct messages.
We should always talk to public channels or groups.
Asking doubts or discussing features in the public channel
help to provide others' point of view into your discussion as well.

So always be open and share with everyone.

**Popular channels and their purpose**

- #general - to talk stuff in general related to our team
- #events - this is where we post details of the events we have
- #random - this is where you post something
  if you don't know which other channel it should go to.
  Eg: talk about a movie you watched,
  your plans for the weekend, etc
- group: your-name-official - this is where you go 
  if you want to talk something confidentially
  directly with the founders
