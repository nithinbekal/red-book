Labels are good way to show everyone what the issue or PR is about. We have a set of common labels we place common in 
every project.

*  **Work in Progress** - there are people working on it
*  **Ready for Review** - The work is done, it needs to be reviewed
*  **Ready for Merge** - The review is done, its ready to be merged
*  **Question** - There are questions posted as comments in the issue, it needs to be answered to progress
*  **Help Required** - This issue has problems which require the help or involvement of another developer
